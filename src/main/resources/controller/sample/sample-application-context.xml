<!-- This is a specific application controller context.
     Each distinct controller should have its own context xml
     and add the to the master-controller-context.
     In addition, this controller can be overridden for testing
     by copying the this file into the src/test/resources location
     and changing any injected resources to stubs, as required.
     Spring will Auto-Detect beans that are controllers based on the @Controller annotation
