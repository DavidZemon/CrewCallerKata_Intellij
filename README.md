Crew Caller Kata
================

Purpose
-------

With the high cost of JetBrain's products, it can be difficult to determine
whether or not IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition is worth the high price. This
project aims to show off as many features of the IDE as possible within a
single scope.

Running the Completed Project
-----------------------------

  1. Check out the project from Git.
  2. If you are running this project from outside Union Pacific's network,
     ensure that maven is always run with "external-to-uprr" profile.
  3. Run "mvn clean package jetty:run" to build the project and start the
     server.
  4. Navigate to "http://localhost:8080/crewCaller" in your browser to view
     available crew for any of the three given days.
